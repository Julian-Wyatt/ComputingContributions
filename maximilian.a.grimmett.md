# Programming Formative Peer Review
## Interest of content
Rating: Outstanding
The topics of AI, Communication, Education and IoT are covered to a reasonable extent of detail. Most pages contain links to sources and some contain images. While it does not contain links to sources, the IoT page stands out both visually and in terms of balanced content.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Rating: Exemplary
The site and its pages keep to a consistent and high quality theme. Transitions between pages using the navbar are seamless giving off the appearance that only the inner content of each page is changing (like on a page whos content is managed by a webserver). Author information is consistent and visually pleasing including a picture for each author as well as image buttons as links to GitHub pages. The only reccomendation would be to make the pages reactive for mobile devices.

## Quality of written presentation
Rating: Outstanding
Apart from minor spelling and grammatical errors, the written presentation is hard to fault. Most pages contain inline hyperlinks to information sources and author information sections are laid out clearly.

## Validity of HTML
Rating: Outstanding
All pages passed the W3 HTML validator. The only error generated for each page is a lack of declaration of character encoding however this is not a major issue.
The HTML its self is legable, well indented and makes good use of Semantic UI styling.

## Evidence of collaboration
### Author info not written by author
Rating: Exemplary
While the author sections of each page do not reference who wrote it, this area cannot be faulted as the commit history clearly demonstrates that each group member submitted author information of another member.

### Balanced contributions from members
Rating: Exemplary
The approach taken here was to all fork the main repository and submit to those. Once ready, group members would submit a pull request to the main repository and the change would need to be approved. There is evidence of this on multiple occasions by all group members.

### Not completed at the last minute
Rating: Very Good
While multiple commits were submitted less than twelve hours before peer review, they appear to just be submitting work that had already been done and making final tweaks which is acceptable. It must also be noted that this isnt necessarily last minute work as multiple commits have been submitted reliably in prior days thus it may just be part of the continued workflow.
