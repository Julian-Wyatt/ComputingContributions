				<h1>Computer Assisted Education</h1>
				<p>
Modern computing has changed society through its impact on Education. Computers, now, have become an integral part to education whether we talk about:

<ul>New and popular fields of study being opened up as a result (like Software Engineering, Computer Sciences, Information Technology, etc.);</ul>
<ul>New methods of learning with computerised simulations and visualisations;</ul>
<ul>Free and public resources being made availible online for other to use, and</ul>
<ul>Recorded lessons and lectures as well as public scientific papers online help to remove the often costly barrier of entry for lots of specialised knowledge.</ul>

In addition to the easier to access resources, computers serve as a tool to add to regular teaching 
environments. PowerPoint presentations allow lectures to involve visualisation in the form of 
animations and slide shows without needing to rely on what lecturers can draw on a board during a 
session. Further, apps like TurningPoint allow students to actively participate in usually non-
participatory lectures y serving students questions remotely to their phones (or other devices).
