                        <h1>Computer Assisted Education</h1>
                        <p>
                            Modern computing has changed society through its impact on Education. Computers, now, have become an integral part to education whether we talk about:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>New and popular fields of study being opened up as a result (like Software Engineering, Computer Sciences, Information Technology, etc.);</li>
                            <li>New methods of learning with computerised simulations and visualisations;</li>
                            <li>Free and public resources being made available online for others to use, and</li>
                            <li>Recorded lessons and lectures as well as public scientific papers online help to remove the often costly barrier of entry for lots of specialised knowledge.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            In addition to the easier to access resources, computers serve as a tool to add to regular teaching 
                            environments. PowerPoint presentations allow lectures to involve visualisation in the form of 
                            animations and slide shows without needing to rely on what lecturers can draw on a board during a 
                            session. Further, apps like TurningPoint allow students to actively participate in usually
                            non-participatory lectures by serving students questions remotely to their phones (or other devices).
                            Lecture recordings and slideshows are often free to view for revision after the lectures have occurred
                            also to allow for students to make up for missed lectures and/or revise an existing topic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The use of specialist software inside of lessons as well can improve how well students learn and retain knowledge.
                            Programs like logic circuit builders, automated testing software and many others allow students to learn and practise 
                            new content without necessary increasing contact time with teachers. Improvements like this save money for educational
                            institutions to fund other projects and overall improve the quality of the education they are able to provide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arguably, one of the most important and significant changes computers have made to education is the ability now for people
                            to self-teach new skills and knowledge. Most of human collective knowledge is available online in some medium to be used for 
                            little to no financial cost. An unprecedented openness in the resources out online means that advanced topics of learning are
                            no longer necessarily locked to those with the money, class or general situation to be able to utilise. A determined enough 
                            individual could teach themselves things like programming or creative writing online for free and go on to get high-end jobs
                            with their self-taught skills without ever having had entered the often costly higher-education.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthering this is institutions like the Open University, which offers formal higher education online for less than most
                            Universities whilst being more convenient for working people to pick up in their free time. A lot of additional costs 
                            associated with University life can be avoided on courses like these.

                    Travis was meant to take a gap year before going to Durham however he managed to get into the
                    course last minute. Before going to Durham, Travis lived in Stockton-on-Tees where
                    he still works in the nightclub "The Wobbly Goblin" as a barman. Being particularly
                    skilful in the game Rainbow Six Siege, Travis is the man you ask if you ever
                    need to tactically breach a building.
