                            As technology has continued to evolve, the ability for us to communicate with each other has massively increased in a large variety of ways. Email, instant messaging services (such as <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> and iMessage) and voice/video communication services (such as <a href="https://skype.com/" target="_blank">Skype</a> and FaceTime) have allowed for people to quickly communicate with each other from across the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The adoption of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank">websocket protocol</a> has allowed for webpages to receive and display updates within milliseconds, and web technology like <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank">WebRTC</a> has allowed for real-time audio and video communication to take place within a web browser (whether it’s a one-on-one conversation, or a livestream being broadcasted to hundreds of thousands of viewers).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            New web technologies have increased the impact of social media for communication. News from across the world is often broken within seconds over <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and the interconnected nature of social networks has allowed for knowledge to spread instantly. The rise of smartphones (and push notifications) has also helped to significantly increase awareness in the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The power of communication was emphasised very recently during the Bangladesh traffic protests in 2018, where social media was used extensively to spread information and photos relating to the ongoing attacks on protesters and journalists to the rest of the world, to the point where authorities started massively slowing down or completely disabling internet access.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Facebook and Twitter also both have services to aid communication during large-scale incidents such as natural disasters. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/crisisresponse/" target="_blank">Facebook’s Safety Check</a> automatically prompts people near the affected area to confirm that they are safe (making use of developments in location tracking), and <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-use-twitter-alerts" target="_blank">Twitter Alerts</a> allows agencies and organisations to immediately update everyone with information relating to an ongoing emergency.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Instant messaging has become so commonplace that access has become a valuable target for hacking and spying, and so encryption technology has continued to improve with it. Several platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal both feature end-to-end encryption, where the message is encrypted by the sender and decrypted by the receiver, making it difficult to understand intercepted messages.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The growth of the internet, the development of new technologies, and the formation of companies dedicated to easing communication have all contributed to creating a connected society where people are able to freely and immediately communicate with each other, without geographical boundaries.
