                        <p> 
                            Many people may have heard of the Internet of Things, but what actually is the Internet of Things? 
                            Well in a fundamental sense, the IoT is the network of interconnected devices that each effectively
                            &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other. For example this could be your phone &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to your &ldquo;watch&rdquo; which are both 
                            &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to the running machine which then &ldquo;talks&rdquo; to your smart mirror and so on. From connecting
                            all of these devices in this way, we can apply other areas of computer science to collect data, learn
                            from this data and then act upon the data gathered, in order to help the user. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>Why do we use the IoT? </h2>
                        <p>
                            The internet of things is useful for a wide range of different tasks, that will, in general,
                            make the user&#39;s life much much easier. This is entirely due to the nature of synchronously performing
                            tasks between devices before even the user thinks they&#39;ll need to do the task. However this is 
                            currently at any infancy stage in terms of the potential for IoT. For example with the potential 
                            for IoT, when leaving the shower, the hair dryer might warm up in advance of typical usage. 
                            Alternatively the fridge freezer may reduce power for a period of time in order to use the washing 
                            machine at the same time which will reduce the net power consumption for people&#39;s housing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>How has the IoT already contributed to society?</h2>
                        <img src="images/IoT2.jpg" class="ui left floated image" style="width:380px;height:275px" alt="Diagram describing the Internet of Things" />
                        <p>
                            In the current concept of the IoT it has already contributed a lot to both society and the technology 
                            industry. Commonly, a lot of people benefit from the &ldquo;smart home&rdquo; system that is implemented through 
                            a range of smart devices such as the hue light bulbs, central heating, kettles, fridges and ovens. 
                            Furthermore, a hugely popular area of the IoT is wearable technology, namely smart watches. These now 
                            have the capability to detect falls and contact emergency services if an accident occurs, which will 
                            literally save lives. Also they can detect a harmful heart rate, which has saved a plethora of lives 
                            already. Modern mobile satellite navigation also applies the use of the IoT in order to detect traffic, 
                            connect through social media and therefore help shorten travel times, lowering fuel consumption and 
                            benefiting the world as a whole. The internet of things further benefits in certain working sectors, 
                            for example the interconnected world would be a able to update colleagues if you&#39;re running late for a 
                            meeting, or could even mean forgetting that awful swipe card so instead the system will use advanced 
                            biometrics to detect where you are and when you arrive and leave work. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Although the IoT hasn&#39;t yet contributed everything it can, it is in strong stead to contribute a vast 
                            range of concepts, some of which are planned and are being worked on; others, on the other hand haven&#39;t 
                            even been thought of yet
                        </p>
                        <h2>What are the potential security risks?</h2>

                        <p>As expected there could be some major security flaws with a huge interconnected mesh based internet. 
                            In order for most devices to interconnect the way they should, it will generally involve the software 
                            to be open source in order to interconnect devices from different publishers and manufacturers, 
                            which is a large security risk and could lead to information being intercepted, or even tricking 
                            the system into asking for data it doesn&#39;t need therefore making cybersecurity a crucial area of 
                            development alongside the development of AI and the IoT. Furthermore the dangers could expand further 
                            than just cyber security through the security, as in the future medical equipment autonomous cars 
                            and automated machinery could be hacked leading to potential physical harm of those around the 
                            equipment. Or even more drastic, a hack of the infrastructure such as traffic lights, which could 
                            lead to thousands of serious car crashes all at once, which will put strain on other areas of the IoT.
