                    <p>
                        Generally, the term &ldquo;artificial intellgence&rdquo; is used when a machine can achieve tasks usually associated
                        with human-like cognitive abilities, such as learning and problem solving.
                    </p>
                    <p> Within artificial intelligence there are many different areas, most notably:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knowledge reasoning</li>
                        <li>Planning</li>
                        <li>Machine learning</li>
                        <li>Natural language processing</li>
                        <li>Computer vision</li>
                        <li>Robotics</li>
                        <li>Artificial general intelligence</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How does this help society?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Previously many tasks had to be done slowly by hand, often taking lots of hours of work. With these new techniques many different
                        processes can be automated, such as fraud detection within banking, airport criminal detection and plagairism checking.
                        Not only can they be automated, they can be much faster and more accurate than a human counterpart. Below are some examples of
                        areas that artificial intelligence is particularly good at.

                        <h4>Social Networking</h4>
                        <p>
                            Most social networking applications use artificial intelligence. For instance, Facebook automatically highlights faces
                            and suggests friends to tag, personalizes your news feed to ensure you're seeing posts that interest you and target you
                            with adverts that you're more likely to click on. In June 2016, Facebook announced &ldquo;DeepText&rdquo;. A text
                            understanding engine that, the company claims &ldquo;can understand with near-human accuracy the textual content of several
                            thousand posts per second, spanning more than 20 languages.&rdquo; DeepText is used in Facebook Messenger to detect
                            intent. For example, by realising you want to hail an Uber from within the app when you message &ldquo;I need a ride&rdquo;.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Online Shopping</h4>
                        <p>
                            When you search on an online shopping site such as Amazon, it quickly returns a list of most relevant products related
                            to your search, this is done using machine learning to produce products it thinks you are trying to find. A similar
