                        <p>
                            Generally, the term &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; is used when a machine can achieve tasks usually associated
                            with human-like cognitive abilities, such as learning and problem solving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within artificial intelligence there are many different areas, most notably:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Knowledge reasoning</li>
                            <li>Planning</li>
                            <li>Machine learning</li>
                            <li>Natural language processing</li>
                            <li>Computer vision</li>
                            <li>Robotics</li>
                            <li>Artificial general intelligence</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>How does this help society?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Previously many tasks had to be done slowly by hand, often taking lots of hours of work. With these new techniques many different
                            processes can be automated, such as fraud detection within banking, airport criminal detection and plagiarism checking.
                            Not only can they be automated, they can be much faster and more accurate than a human counterpart. Below are some examples of
                            areas that artificial intelligence is particularly good at.

                            <h3>Social Networking</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.rankmyapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/75eTzJt.png" style="width:225px;height:150px" alt="Social networks" /> 
                            <p>
                                Most social networking applications use artificial intelligence. For instance, Facebook automatically highlights faces
                                and suggests friends to tag, personalizes your news feed to ensure you're seeing posts that interest you and target you
                                with adverts that you're more likely to click on. In June 2016, Facebook announced &ldquo;DeepText&rdquo;. A text
                                understanding engine that, the company claims &ldquo;can understand with near-human accuracy the textual content of several
                                thousand posts per second, spanning more than 20 languages.&rdquo; DeepText is used in Facebook Messenger to detect
                                intent. For example, by realising you want to hail an Uber from within the app when you message &ldquo;I need a ride&rdquo;.

                            <h3>Online Shopping</h3>
                            <img src="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J6cQ63OJL.png" class="ui image right floated" style="width:150px;height:150px" alt="Amazon" />
                            <p>
                                When you search on an online shopping site such as Amazon, it quickly returns a list of most relevant products related
                                to your search, this is done using machine learning to produce products it thinks you are trying to find. A similar technique
                                is used when recommending what you might want to buy, things such as previous searches, purchases, liked items or added to cart are factors taken into
                                account. Even brand preferences can be considered too.

                            <p>
                                Intel aims to create one-day precision medicine for cancer patients -- that means going to the doctor, getting a
                                diagnosis and receiving a personalized treatment plan -- all in 24 hours.
                                &ldquo;Using a high-performance computing system, oncologists will be able to employ AI to compare a patient's molecular test
                                results with a vast database of previous cases. Once a match is found, the physician can use this research to customize
                                each patient's treatment plan, all in one day.&rdquo; - <a href="https://iq.intel.com/artificial-intelligence-is-good-for-society/">Intel</a>

                            <h3>Online Customer Support <i class="user icon" style="color: rebeccapurple;margin: 0px 20px"></i></h3>
                            <p>
                                A number of websites nowadays offer the option to chat with customer support representative while they are navigating within the site.
                                However, not every website has a live executive to answer your queries. In most of the cases, you talk to a chatbot.
                                These bots tend to extract information from the website and present it to the customers.
                                Meanwhile, the chatbots advance with time. They tend to understand the user queries better and serve them with better answers,
                                which is possible due to its machine learning algorithms. - <a href="https://medium.com/app-affairs/9-applications-of-machine-learning-from-day-to-day-life-112a47a429d0">Medium.com</a>
